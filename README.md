# Eric Zorn - Senior Software Engineer ðŸ¤™

Hey everyone! My name is Eric Zorn. I am a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer. I currently enjoy working primarily within the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS) stack with an emphasis on `TypeScript`.

Some of my favorite front-end technologies of choice are React, Redux and Redux Toolkit, Apollo Client, Formik, React Hook Form, Yup, NextJS, Gatsby, Framer Motion, and recently Svelte with Svelte Kit.

My Favorite back-end technologies consits of NestJS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MariaDB/MySQL, Redis, Apollo Server, GraphQL, AWS, ExpressJS, Golang with the Fiber framework, Auth0, and many others.

Although this is my current tech stack of choice, technology is always evolving and I adapt to the changes. I am always learning new web tech and new programming languages.

I have programmed previously in other stacks as well, such as Python (Flask and Django), Ruby on Rails, and recently have really enjoyed Golang and Fiber or Gorilla Mux and Gin as my frameworks of choice. During my Master's program I had also used PHP and Java on many projects.

I have worked on very large enterprise engineering teams, working in `microservices` as part of our large back-end infrastructure and have recently been working to build a large `micro-front-end` infrastructure around the `SingleSPA` framework for our current UI Platform.

I too am a testing enthusiast and prefer utilizing the `Jest` assertion/test-runner framework in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem. For backend E2E tests, I use both supertest and newman from Postman. On the frontend, I use both Cypress or Selenium Web Driver and Puppeteer.
